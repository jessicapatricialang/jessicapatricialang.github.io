In my dissertation supervised by <a><u> href="https://www.eui.eu/people?id=ellen-margaretha-immergut" target="_blank"> Prof. Ellen M. Immergut</u></a>, 
I assess how <strong>changes in the mass media discourse</strong>
initiated by activists influence public opinion and political participation 
in the field of environmental degradation and climate change. 
I am currently working on the Swiss case focusing on the years 1970 to 2024. 

<br><br>
I am keen to explore in greater detail the <strong>consequences of political institutions losing legitimacy</strong> due to their inability to adequately tackle 
environmental crises. My side project together with <a><u> href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/laura-gatto-107423134" target="_blank"> Laura Gatto</u></a> (Université de Lausanne) is partially speaking to this interest. We assess the extent to which 
journalists address perceived or experienced spatial (in)justices related to climate policy and investigate the consequences thereof for individuals’ 
voting behaviour.

In the past year, I undertook a couple of research stays, whereby I visited the <a><u> href="https://www.gu.se/en/socav" target="_blank">University of Gothenburg</u></a> in June and July 2024, 
the <a><u> href="https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank">University of Zurich</u></a>, where I was also teaching a BA seminar, from February to May 2024, and the <a><u> href="https://www.wzb.eu/en" target="_blank">Berlin Social Science Centre</u></a> from September 2023 to January 2024. 
I completed my MA in Political Science and my BA in German Language and Literature, and Political Science at the University of Zurich. 
During my MA, I spent a semester at <a><u> href="https://www.sciencespo-lille.eu/" target="_blank">Sciences Po Lille</u></a>.
