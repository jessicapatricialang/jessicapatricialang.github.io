In my dissertation, supervised by <a href="https://www.eui.eu/people?id=ellen-margaretha-immergut" target="_blank"><u>Prof. Ellen M. Immergut</u></a>, 
  I adopt a discursive lens to empirically assess processes of cultural change as initiated by social movements. Specifically, I assess the capacity of 
  activists to achieve <strong>changes in mass media discourse</strong> around issues concerning environmental degradation and climate change. I further explore 
  how these discursive shifts affect public opinion and political participation. 
  I am currently working on the Swiss case, focusing on the years 1974 to 2024. 

<br><br>
I am keen to explore in greater detail the <strong>consequences of political institutions losing legitimacy</strong> due to their inability to adequately tackle 
environmental crises. My side project, together with <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/laura-gatto-107423134" target="_blank"><u>Laura Gatto</u></a> (Universit√© de Lausanne) is partially speaking to this interest. 
  We assess the extent to which journalists address perceived or experienced spatial (in)justices arising from climate policy and 
  investigate the consequences thereof for the 
  voting behaviour of citizens.

In the past year, I undertook a couple of research stays. I visited the <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/socav" target="_blank"><u>University of Gothenburg</u></a> in June and July 2024, 
the <a href="https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank"> <u> University of Zurich</u></a>, where I was also teaching a BA seminar, from February to May 2024, and 
  the <a href="https://www.wzb.eu/en" target="_blank"><u>Berlin Social Science Centre</u></a> from September 2023 to January 2024. 
I completed my MA in Political Science and my BA in German Language and Literature, and Political Science at the University of Zurich.
