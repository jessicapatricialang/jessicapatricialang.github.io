I am currently a PhD researcher at <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences" target="_blank"><u>European University Institute</u></a> in Florence, 
Italy. Furthermore, I serve as the Chair of the ECPR Standing Group on Participation and Mobilisation, and co-coordinate EUI's Environmental and Climate Politics Working Group. 
My research interest revolves around <strong>the ways democratic societies make sense</strong> of environmental crises such as climate change or biodiversity loss and 
develop a hegemonic understanding of legitimate ways to address them.
